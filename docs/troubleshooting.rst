Upgrading betterproto in a poetry environment
=============================================

It seems like in some situations, installing and then updating ``betterproto`` 
in ``poetry`` environments doesn't work. 
If, after updating ``betterproto``, you're not getting the new features you wanted, 
it might be because of the current virtual environment ``poetry`` has created. 
While there's probably a "surgical" fix, we've found that removing the venv and re-installing it works.

To do that, run ``poetry env info`` to see the venv path:

.. code-block:: shell
   :emphasize-lines: 5

   $ poetry env info 
   Virtualenv
   Python:         3.8.7
   Implementation: CPython
   Path:           /home/username/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/project-name-random-py3.8  # <-- THIS PATH
   Valid:          True

Then just ``rm -rf`` that path to delete the venv, 
and re-create the env using ``poetry shell`` and ``poetry install``.
