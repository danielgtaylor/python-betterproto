// This is a minimal example of a repeated message field that caused issues when
// checking whether a message is a map.
//
// During the check wheter a field is a "map", the string "entry" is added to
// the field name, checked against the type name and then further checks are
// made against the nested type of a parent message. In this edge-case, the
// first check would pass even though it shouldn't and that would cause an
// error because the parent type does not have a "nested_type" attribute.
